    <h1>FBLA Code of Conduct</h1>

    <p>The conduct of FBLA members, advisers, and representatives should reflect positively on the organization and themselves, upholding the reputation of the organization. Listed below are rules of conduct for FBLA members, advisers, representatives, and attendees of events.</p>

    <h2>General Expectations</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Behave in a courteous and respectful manner, avoiding language or actions that might bring discredit upon themselves, their school, other attendees, advisers, or FBLA. This includes speech and conduct that creates an intimidating, hostile, or offensive environment.</li>
      <li>Promote FBLA as a positive experience and therefore act as a positive role model for students in dress, voice, attitude, actions, and demeanor.</li>
      <li>Obey all local, state, and federal laws.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>While Participating in an FBLA Event</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Abide by all FBLA rules. Members must keep their advisers informed of their activities and whereabouts. Accidents, injuries, and illnesses must be reported to the local adviser(s) or state leader(s) immediately.</li>
      <li>Avoid conduct not conducive to an educational conference, including actions disrupting the conference’s professional atmosphere, association with non-conference individuals, and activities that endanger self or others.</li>
      <li>Comply with the rules of all event facilities. Remember that other guests have rights as well. Noise should be kept at a respectful volume. Individuals or chapters will be responsible for repairing or replacing any property or furniture that is damaged. Facilities have the right to ask guests to leave.</li>
      <li>Stay in the hotel room to which they are assigned. FBLA members must have permission from their local adviser(s) or state leader(s) to be in hotel rooms to which they are not assigned.</li>
      <li>Follow the FBLA Dress Code during all conference activities, including general sessions, competitive events, exhibits, regional meetings, workshops, and other activities unless otherwise indicated.</li>
      <li>Avoid smoking, use of vaping/e-cigarette devices, alcoholic beverages, cannabis, and controlled or illegal substances of any form. These items must not be used or possessed at any time, or under any circumstances. Use or possession of such substances may subject the attendee to criminal prosecution. This policy does not apply to medications legally prescribed for an individual attendee.</li>
      <li>Not possess or use weapons of any kind at an FBLA-related event.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Supervision and Responsibility</h2>
    <p>Local advisers and state leaders are responsible for the supervision of attendee conduct. They should refer to the Chaperone Policy for additional responsibilities.</p>

    <h2>Code of Conduct Violations</h2>
    <p>Should an attendee violate the Code of Conduct, the FBLA staff member on duty will meet with the attendee and/or state leader(s) and local adviser(s)/chaperone(s).</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Attendees who violate the Code of Conduct may be subject to disciplinary action, up to and including expulsion from the conference. Attendees who are expelled from the conference will not be eligible for a refund of any fees paid and will be sent home at their own expense.</li>
      <li>Attendees may be given a warning for behavior, and their adviser(s)/chaperone(s) will be notified.</li>
      <li>Attendees may be remanded to the custody of their adviser(s)/chaperone(s) and banned from all conference activities and facilities. FBLA will require that the adviser(s)/chaperone(s) notify a student attendee’s parents/guardians.</li>
      <li>If an attendee’s behavior or actions violate the law, FBLA will notify local security and authorities immediately.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>By registering for FBLA events, participants acknowledge their understanding of the Code of Conduct and the consequences of violating it.</p>
